  <h2>Disease Name</h2>
  <p>
    Trichomoniasis
  </p>

  <h3>Pathophysiology / Brief description</h3>
  <p>
    Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection of the vagina or urethra that is caused by the protozoa Trichomonas 
    vaginalis and that causes vaginal irritation and discharge and sometimes urinary symptoms. Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated, 
    sexually transmitted protozoan that more often infects women than men. Trichomonas can be transmitted by exposure to sexual fluids during vaginal,
    anal, or oral sex, even if ejaculation does not occur. The incubation period for trichomoniasis is approximately 1 week to 1 month but can be much longer. 
    Infection may be asymptomatic in either sex. In men, the organism may persist for long periods in the genitourinary tract without causing symptoms and may be transmitted to sex partners. 
    The infection confers no immunity to future reinfection.
  </p>

  <p> 
    The most common site for infection in men is the urethra, and in women, the cervix. 
    It is uncommon for Trichomonas to infect the rectum, and it is not known to infect the oropharynx. 
    Routine screening for T. vaginalis should be considered for women in high-risk populations, including HIV-positive women, 
    and women seeking care for vaginal discharge.
</p>

 <p>
    Coinfection with gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is common.
 </p>


  <dl>
    <h3>Risk factors</h3>
    <dd>
        -Who are at risk?
      <dl>
        <dd>●	Having an older sex partner and concurrent Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection.</dd>
        <dd>●	Women are more susceptible to Trishomoniasis than men.</dd>
        <dd>●	Having sex with infected people</dd>
       <br>
        -Risks of Trichomoniasis
        <p>
            The main complications of untreated trichomoniasis are related to the inflammation and irritation that the infection causes in the genital tract.
            This irritation makes an infected person more likely to acquire or transmit another STI, particularly HIV. While gonorrhea and chlamydial infection are 
            responsible for the vast majority of PID, trichomoniasis infection is associated with PID in women with HIV.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are pregnant, your doctor will talk with you about treatment. 
            Trich may cause problems with pregnancy. You could pass it to your baby during a vaginal delivery. 
            But this is rare.
        </p>

    




      </dl>
      <h3>Clinical manifestations</h3>
      <dl>
        <p>
        In women, symptoms of trichomoniasis range from none to copious, yellow-green, frothy vaginal discharge with a fishy odor, 
        and soreness of the vulva and perineum, dyspareunia, and dysuria. 
        Asymptomatic infection may become symptomatic at any time as the vulva and perineum become inflamed and edema develops in the labia. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The vaginal walls and surface of the cervix may have punctate, red “strawberry” spots. Urethritis and possibly cystitis may also occur.
    </p>
    <p>
        Men are usually asymptomatic; however, sometimes urethritis results in a discharge that may be transient, 
        frothy, or purulent or that causes dysuria and frequency, usually early in the morning. Often, urethritis is mild and causes only minimal urethral irritation and occasional 
        moisture at the urethral meatus, under the foreskin, or both. Epididymitis and prostatitis are rare complications.
    </p>
      </dl>
    </dd>

    <h3>Diagnostics test</h3>
   <dd>
    <dl>
        •Vaginal testing with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), Vaginal pH and wet-mount microscopic examination, Immunochromatographic flow/rapid-antigen dipstick tests, or Papanicolaou (Pap) smear.
    </dl>
    <dl>
        •Culture of urine or urethral swabs from men
    </dl>
    <dl>
        Trichomoniasis should be suspected in women with vaginitis, in men with urethritis, and in their sex partners. 
        Suspicion is high if symptoms persist after patients have been evaluated and treated for other infections such as gonorrhea 
        and chlamydia infections.
    </dl>

    <dl>
        NAATs are more sensitive than microscopic examination or culture for diagnosis of trichomoniasis in women. 
        Immunochromatographic flow dipstick tests are also available for point of care testing in women. 
        Cervical cytology (Pap test) is not used to test for trichomoniasis, but infection is sometimes detected incidentally.
    </dl>

    <dl>
        Microscopic examination enables clinicians to evaluate for trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis at the same time, 
        because they cause similar symptoms and/or may coexist. Vaginal secretions are obtained from the posterior fornix. 
        The pH is measured. Secretions are then placed on 2 slides; they are diluted with 10% potassium hydroxide on one slide (KOH wet mount) 
        and with 0.9% sodium chloride on the other (saline wet mount). For the whiff test, the KOH wet mount is checked for a fishy odor, which results 
        from amines produced in bacterial vaginosis. The saline wet mount is examined microscopically as soon as possible to detect trichomonads, which can 
        become immotile and more difficult to recognize within minutes after slide preparation. (Trichomonads are pear-shaped with flagella, often motile, and 
        average 7 to 10 micrometers—about the size of white blood cells but occasionally reach 25 micrometers.) If trichomoniasis is present, numerous neutrophils are also present. 
        Culture of urine or urethral swabs is the only validated test for detecting T. vaginalis in men. In men, microscopy of urine is insensitive, and NAATs are not currently cleared by the 
        FDA but could be available if local laboratories have done internal validation studies.
    </dl>

    <dl>
        As with diagnosis of any STI, patients with trichomoniasis should be tested to exclude other common STIs such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.
    </dl>
   </dd>

<dl>
    <h2>Treatment/Medications</h2>

    <dd>●	Oral metronidazole(Antiprotozoal) or tinidazole</dd>
    <dd>●	Treatment of sex partners</dd>
    <dd>●	Vaginal Suppository</dd>
    <dl>
        Women with Trichomoniasis should receive metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. 
        Men should receive metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose. An alternative treatment for women and men 
        is tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose.
    </dl>
    <dl>
        If infection persists in women and reinfection by sex partners has been excluded, 
        women should be retreated with metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for 7 days or Tinidazole 2 g orally once a day for 7 days.
    </dl>
    <dl>
        Metronidazole may cause leukopenia, disulfiram-like reactions to alcohol, or candidal superinfections. 
        It is relatively contraindicated during early pregnancy, although it may not be dangerous to the fetus after the 1st trimester. 
        Tinidazole has not been established as safe during pregnancy and so is not used.
    </dl>

    <dl>
        Sex partners should be seen and treated for trichomoniasis with the same regimens based on sex and should be screened for other STIs. 
        If poor adherence to follow-up by sex partners is likely, treatment can be initiated in sex partners of patients with documented trichomoniasis without confirming the diagnosis in the partner. 

    </dl>
    <dl>
        Vaginal creams and suppositories, if prescribed, does not cure Trichomoniasis it only alleviates the symptoms especially itching.
    </dl>

</dl>

<dl>
    <h2>Nursing Interventions/healing</h2>
    <dl>
        Use a cold water compress or cool baths to relieve itching. For drug therapy; Patients and their partners should be treated with either Metronidazole (Flagyl) or Tinidazole (Tindamax). 
        Explain to the patient the possible side-effects and restrictions of the drugs. Instruct patients to abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after treatment and until all sexual partners have completed a 
        full course of treatment. Tell patient not to stop taking them just because they feel better. They need to take the full course of antibiotics. Advise patients to return if symptoms persist or recur. 
        Any sexual partner within the preceding 60 days should be treated. Explain the importance of condoms or other barrier methods with every sexual contact. 
        Because of a high rate of reoccurrence of trichomoniasis, repeat testing 3-6 months after treatment is recommended.
